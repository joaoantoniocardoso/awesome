This is my configuration file for Awesome Window Manager version 3.5

It is based on a config called Powerarrow Darker, originally made by https://github.com/copycat-killer, avaliable at https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats.

###Main things that I modified:
  Battery widget based on `/sys/class/power_supply`; 
  Keys to control Backlight; 
  Keys to control ALSA volume; 
  Keys to control transparency of focused window; 
  
###Main things that I added from wikis:
  By direction client focus, like in Terminator; 
  MenuBar to lauch/search programs by typing its name; 
  Displays the layout name of current tag when it changes;
